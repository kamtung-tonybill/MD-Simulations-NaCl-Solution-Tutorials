# Model System - NaCl in an Aqueous Solution

In this set of tutorials, we will use MD simulations to study some equilibrium properties of NaCl in an aqueous solution and the association/dissociation of the ions. We will model a system with 1 Na, 1 Cl, and 106 water molecules. The system is obtained from another [PLUMED tutorial](https://www.plumed.org/doc-v2.9/user-doc/html/ves-lugano2017-metad.html).
